                <h2>Tate Daniela</h2> <br>
                <P>Hi! My name is Daniela, I am 24 years old and I am originally from the Republic of Moldova. About 4 years ago, I was the owner of a Redbubble store. Although I had some very successful designs and posted daily, my store was still not successful. Initially, I started to promote my store through Facebook groups, at the moment this was the only method I knew. But I never gave up, because I knew that after a lot of work and effort, beautiful results eventually appear. Over time, I advanced in this field, let's call it that, and I started to achieve great results to my surprise. Since then I decided to help other people, who in their time also managed to bring traffic within 2 weeks. With all this, I decided to offer the great communities of artists a helping hand so that in the end their work is also appreciated!</P>
